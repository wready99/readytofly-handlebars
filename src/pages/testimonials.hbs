She has been wonderful to work with and sensitive to my unique needs as a mother, wife, and professional. She drills down to the essences of issues and challenges them head on. She listens and respects personal opinions while challenging beliefs at the same time. She works to empower the client to find the answers instead of spoon-feeding them. I have appreciated her willingness to be flexible and yet still keep the conversation moving forward. Fiona is attentive to details, observant, and always willing to work hard for the outcome. She also holds you accountable to your agreements and responsibilities.&rdquo;</blockquote>

In the few months I have been working with her, she has been helping me work through my inner critic and often realize that whatever emotion or obstacle that is working me up often has something more deep rooted, or even a completely different underlying cause.   As a mompreneur seeking balance between my wild ideas, taking care of family and my relationship with my husband, she is helping me find acceptance of myself, the ability to hone in on a path in my business, while helping me find ways to do so without feeling like I am sacrificing my family.&rdquo;</blockquote>

Her method involved getting me to define areas where I felt I could improve or had challenges, and then work out the solutions together. She then used her expertise to produce a framework to implement them. My coaching sessions were certainly enlightening and at the end of each one I felt empowered to make the right kind of changes to improve my life. to do so without feeling like I am sacrificing my family.&rdquo;</blockquote>

Although expected, events left me confused and wondering how to make sure my next move was the right one for me. Fiona asked the questions that I hadn't realised I needed someone to ask. She was never intrusive but encouraged me to challenge my ingrained thoughts and attitudes. I never would have had the guts to go for what I did without our discussions. I would definitely recommend Fiona's coaching&mdash;in fact, I have recommended her to my sister and a good friend. She is very approachable, clear, willing to share her experiences but never pushes her own opinion. Thank you so much Fiona! Life would be so easy if everyone had a Fiona along for the ride!&rdquo;</blockquote>

Fiona helped me back on track by helping me to formulate and verbalize my goals, create small manageable steps to meet them, and to realize ways in which I am holding myself back.  As someone who is both a perfectionist and an introvert, it can be challenging for me to open up to people about my inner thoughts. Fiona has a great way about her – being simultaneously supportive and direct, which has helped me feel comfortable talking to her.  She is honest, open, and works hard to help each person be the best version of themselves that they can be.  If you’re looking to get out of your own way and to start moving towards success, happiness and self-confidence, Fiona can help!&rdquo;</blockquote>
