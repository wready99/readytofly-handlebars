Fiona is perceptive, astute, encouraging, creative, funny, and challenging as a coach. She has a knack for bringing out the best in people&mdash;offering opportunities and paths you never thought of, helping you excel at your strengths, managing any pitfalls, and helping you experience greater joy. I highly recommend her, especially for anyone seeking support with achieving new goals!&rdquo;</blockquote>

Although expected, events left me confused and wondering how to make sure my next move was the right one for me. Fiona asked the questions that I hadn't realised I needed someone to ask. She was never intrusive but encouraged me to challenge my ingrained thoughts and attitudes. I never would have had the guts to go for what I did without our discussions. I would definitely recommend Fiona's coaching&mdash;in fact, I have recommended her to my sister and a good friend. She is very approachable, clear, willing to share her experiences but never pushes her own opinion. Thank you so much Fiona! Life would be so easy if everyone had a Fiona along for the ride!&rdquo;</blockquote>
